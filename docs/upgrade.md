# How to upgrade ReviOS to a newer version?

## Information and prerequisites

With newer builds of ReviOS we provide 2 separate ISOs. One for installing a completely new ReviOS instance, and one for upgrading a previous ReviOS version. This way, the users can update their ReviOS instance without reinstalling and losing files.

!!! danger
    ==**This is an EXPERIMENTAL method**==. Upgrading was tested numerous times, but we obviously cannot cover all the edge cases, so use this with caution!

This method is only working if you are upgrading a **previous ReviOS installation** that is at least on the **21H2** Windows version, or a stock Windows (but for that a complete fresh installation is more preferable). Upgrading from **other** custom **tweaked** systems is neither working nor supported. Cross-upgrades, like from ReviOS 10 to 11 or vice versa, should work, but it is not tested. 

And you need **at least 20-25 GB of free space** on the partition you have ReviOS installed (usually called `C:`).

## Step 1: Download the ISO

Download the latest **Upgrade** build of ReviOS 10 or 11 from the [Download page of our website](https://www.revi.cc/revios/download).

==Make sure you download the `Upgrade` option.==

### Verification

In the File Explorer go where you downloaded the ISO file, and ++shift+"Right-click"++ on an empty space of the window, and select `Open PowerShell window here`. Type in the following command:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -Path <file name>
```

And replace the `<file name>` part with the name of the ReviOS installer file's name. **You can use the ++tab++ button to autocomplete the file name.** For example: `Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -Path .\ReviOS-10-22.10-Upgrade.iso`

When the command returns with the hash of the file, compare it to the corresponding MD5 hash value on the [Verification page on the Revision website](https://www.revi.cc/revios/download/verify){target=_blank}. If they match, it means the ISO file is not corrupted, you can carry on with the process.


## Step 2: Preparation

To begin with, it is mandatory to **extract the files of the ISO file** on the partition where ReviOS is installed. Either by mounting the image and copying the files out, or with an file archiver software, like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). 

This is important, because the **upgrading process will not work just running from the mounted ISO**. 

Another scenarios when it might not work are if you extracted the ISO to a USB or a network mounted drive.

So **make sure the files are on your PC**. The easiest way if you just do it on your `Desktop` or the root of the Windows partition, usually called `C:`.


## Step 3: Starting

Now all you have to do is to **run the `upgrade.bat` file**.

The following should open. **If not, see the [Possible issues](#possible-issues)**

Here, just go through with the defaults the installation give you. (Next, Accept, Install)

And you should arrive to the following screen:

==**It is not actually installing **Windows Server**. ReviOS *tricks* the `setup.exe` file which gives people ability to upgrade to ReviOS 11 builds on hardwares without TPM and SecureBoot**==.

From now on, you only need to just wait. For how long is varied by the hardware, since the installer has to duplicate the OS and then set up the new one.

While upgrading, your OS will reboot multiple times.

### Possible issues

If you get the error `Unable to create required installation folder // Error code: 0x8030002F`, and you have done everything according to the guide, a **restart** usually solves it.

If a reboot has not solved this issue for you, you are probably affected by an issue in Windows itself. You can try the following steps in order.

1. If you copied the files from the mounted ISO or used WinRAR before, **try [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)** for extraction and then run the `upgrade.bat` again.
2. Run the `setup.exe` directly, instead of using the `upgrade.bat`. And select not to install updates, although it seems like this setting does not affect the upgrading of ReviOS.
3. Try **step 1** from [this guide](https://windowsreport.com/unable-create-required-installation-folder/#1). This must be a last resort, since it will give access to the `Local` folder inside `AppData` for everyone and everything.

If none of these steps have solved the issue, you will have to do a [clean installation](install.md). Upgrading **will not work on your machine**.

## Step 4: Finalizing

After upgrading, the OS will run its preparation again, just like the after a fresh installation. By default, ReviOS does not remove the Windows.old folder, because some users prefer old version. To clean it up, you can run Disk Cleanup as administrator and choose `Previous Windows installations(s)`, [more information](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/remove-previous-windows-installations).
